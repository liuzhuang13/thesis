With the popularity of Transformers, there is a 

\subsection{Studying Inductive Biases}
Just as Chapter~\ref{chap:convnext} demonstrated, the comparison between ConvNets and Transformers are often conflated with detailed architecture specifications, thus leading to 

The debate between ConvNets \vs Transformers are sometimes

\subsection{Multi-modal Learning}


While there is promise to build a unified AI system that handles a variety of tasks, potentially using Transformers, we believe different architectures could still thrive together. Such a giant model may not

Is scaling all you need?
